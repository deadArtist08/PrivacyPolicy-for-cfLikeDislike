I have taken the user's handle name from the codeforces website and used that to store the problems he/she liked/disliked on codeforces
If he like/dislike a problem using my extension then I will store that this user has liked/disliked this particular porblem. Now for each
problem I have gathered all the likes/dislikes and displayed them right next to the problem and for each user I displayed all the problems they liked/disliked
by coloring and disabling the buttons.
Other than that I've not collected any other information about the extension user.
